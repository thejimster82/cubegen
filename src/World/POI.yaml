points of interest are a major component of this game
they will be procedurally generated and placed in the world in the first pass, not as a second pass over the terrain
they can be a major source of quests and story
they can have unique structures and decorations
they can have unique flora and fauna
they can have unique events and activities
they can have unique friendly and hostile NPCs
they can have unique resources and loot
they can have unique challenges and obstacles
they can have unique rewards and benefits
they can have unique names and backstories

the generation of points of interest needs to be efficient such that the world can be generated in real-time as the player explores
some points of interest consist of a single structure, some with multiple structures near one another
sometimes a 'structure' is a natural formation like a lake
some are just a structure, others affect the area around them.
  - for example, towns might affect the surrounding area such that there are now farms where there would be trees
  - for example, a volcano might affect the surrounding area such that there are now lava flows where there would be stone
  - for example a lake might affect the surrounding area such that there are now streams flowing into the lake where before there would just be land
in this way they are not unlike sub-biomes, affecting their surroundings in a blended way but instead of just being a distinct set of environmental
characteristics, they can have structures etc. and all of what has been described above.
